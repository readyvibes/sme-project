A website that allows you to reach out and ask questions to software engineers that are subject matter experts in a particular field.

Features (High Level):

* People can either post questions in a forum where only certified subject matter experts can answer
    * In a exclusive option, some people can even directly message their question to a subject matter expert
* People can watch interactive tutorials on different topics
    * These tutorials can be high level and compressed for users that are looking to implement something quickly
    * These tutorials can also be very low level and in depth for users that are looking to understand more thoroughly 
* Users can participate in either live or online conferences for different topics 
* Filter topics or questions based on technologies or companies


Things to Discuss:

* How can qualify someone to being a subject matter expert in a particular field? 
    * Check if anyone has vouched for their skills on LinkedIn?
    * Give them a very short 30 min quiz with 20 questions? 
        * Based on the answers they give, it can tell us their level of expertise
